# Real-time System Usage Monitor API

This project is a simple Flask-based REST API that provides real-time system usage information, including CPU usage, RAM usage, network usage, processor name, and OS version. It can be used to monitor the system's performance and can be easily integrated into a web-based dashboard.

## Features

- **CPU Usage:** Monitors and reports the current CPU usage as a percentage.
- **RAM Usage:** Provides the current memory usage as a percentage.
- **Network Usage:** Tracks bytes sent and received over the network.
- **System Info:** Returns the processor name and OS version.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- **Flask** and **psutil** Python packages. You can install them using pip:


  ```bash
  pip install flask psutil
